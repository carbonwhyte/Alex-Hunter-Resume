## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Chief Operating Officer, 2024:

Alex is a solid Senior Product Owner making his way to Head of Product. He creates environments for collaboration and autonomy amongst engineers and designers while keeping everyone’s attention on the end goal. He is very attentive to the team’s wellbeing and working dynamic, always looking to maintain a healthy culture. He was instrumental in turning visions into achievable outcomes, using a methodical problem-solving approach. I highly recommend Alex for a Senior Product Owner or Head of Product role due to his depth of product experience, positive work culture, and adaptability.

### PSM III Scrum Master, 2024:

I had the privilege to work with Alex on an innovative greenfield project for several months. He navigated an ever-changing environment with grace and composure, making the complex role of a product owner seem effortless—a true sign of professional mastery. Alex's ability to listen before speaking quickly earns him trust and acceptance as a leader. He consistently creates clarity in challenging situations and understands agile principles deeply. After my 20+ years in software development, Alex stands out as the benchmark for a great product owner, and I would consider myself very lucky to work with him again.
